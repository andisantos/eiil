## Reproducing paper results

### Sythetic data
To produce results
```
cd InvariantRiskMinimization/code/experiment_synthetic/
./run_sems.sh
```
To analyze results
```
noteooks/sem_results.ipynb
```

### Color MNIST
To produce results
```
./exps/cmnist_label_noise_sweep.sh
```
To analyze results
```
notebooks/plot_cmnist_label_noise_sweep.ipynb
```
As an alternative, `InvariantRiskMinimization/code/colored_mnist/optimize_envs.sh` also runs EIIL+IRM on CMNIST with 25% label noise (the default from the IRM paper).
